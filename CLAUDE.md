## Project Overview

KoproGo is a SaaS property management platform built with **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters) and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. The system emphasizes performance (P99 < 5ms latency), testability, security (GDPR compliant), and ecological sustainability (< 0.5g CO2/request target).

**Stack**: Rust + Actix-web (backend), Astro + Svelte (frontend), PostgreSQL 15

**Frontend Architecture**: 178 composants Svelte (islands), 22 API clients, 13 shared utils/validators/services (hexagonal light)

**Testing**: 819 BDD scenarios (69 features), 49 E2E smoke tests, 12 Documentation Vivante scenarios

**i18n**: 4 langues (FR/NL/EN/DE), ~2000 clés par locale, 73% couverture

## Security & Monitoring

KoproGo includes production-grade security and observability:

**Implemented (Issues #39, #40, #41, #43, #78):**
- ✅ **LUKS Encryption at Rest**: Full-disk encryption for PostgreSQL data and uploads (AES-XTS-512)
- ✅ **Encrypted Backups**: Daily GPG-encrypted backups with S3 off-site storage (7d local, configurable S3 lifecycle)
- ✅ **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Alertmanager (30d metrics, 7d logs)
- ✅ **Intrusion Detection**: Suricata IDS with custom rules (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, etc.)
- ✅ **WAF Protection**: CrowdSec community threat intelligence
- ✅ **fail2ban**: Custom jails for SSH, Traefik, API abuse, PostgreSQL brute-force
- ✅ **SSH Hardening**: Key-only authentication, modern ciphers, reduced attack surface
- ✅ **Kernel Hardening**: sysctl security configuration (SYN cookies, IP spoofing protection, ASLR)
- ✅ **Security Auditing**: Automated Lynis audits (weekly), rkhunter scans (daily), AIDE file integrity monitoring
- ✅ **Application Security Headers**: HSTS (1 year), CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- ✅ **Login Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP (anti-brute-force protection)
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: JWT secret strength enforcement (min 32 chars), CORS origin validation (no wildcards)

**Monitoring Endpoints:**
- Prometheus: http://vps-ip:9090
- Grafana: http://vps-ip:3001
- Alertmanager: http://vps-ip:9093
- Backend metrics: http://vps-ip:8080/metrics

**Documentation:** See [`infrastructure/SECURITY.md`](infrastructure/SECURITY.md) for complete setup and configuration.

**Quick deploy:**
```bash
# VPS (Docker Compose)
make -f infrastructure/Makefile.infra ansible-setup ENV=production ARCH=vps SITE=monosite

# K3s
make -f infrastructure/Makefile.infra ansible-setup ENV=production ARCH=k3s SITE=monosite
```

## Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

The backend follows strict layering with dependency inversion:

```
Domain (Core)
  ↑ defines interfaces
Application (Use Cases + Ports)
  ↑ implements ports
Infrastructure (Adapters: Web, Database)
```

### Layer Rules (CRITICAL)

1. **Domain Layer** (`backend/src/domain/`):
   - Pure business logic, NO external dependencies
   - Contains `entities/` (aggregates with invariant validation) and `services/` (domain services)
   - Entities enforce business rules in constructors (e.g., `Building::new()` validates name is non-empty)
   - All domain tests are in-module `#[cfg(test)]` blocks

2. **Application Layer** (`backend/src/application/`):
   - `ports/`: Trait definitions (interfaces) like `BuildingRepository`
   - `use_cases/`: Orchestration logic (e.g., `BuildingUseCases`)
   - `dto/`: Data Transfer Objects for API contracts
   - Depends ONLY on Domain layer

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`backend/src/infrastructure/`):
   - `database/repositories/`: PostgreSQL implementations of ports (e.g., `PostgresBuildingRepository`)
   - `web/handlers/`: Actix-web HTTP handlers
   - `web/routes.rs`: API route configuration
   - Depends on Application layer (implements ports)

### Key Pattern Example

```rust
// Domain: backend/src/domain/entities/building.rs
impl Building {
    pub fn new(...) -> Result<Self, String> {
        // Business invariants enforced here
    }
}

// Application: backend/src/application/ports/building_repository.rs
#[async_trait]
pub trait BuildingRepository: Send + Sync {
    async fn create(&self, building: &Building) -> Result<Building, String>;
}

// Infrastructure: backend/src/infrastructure/database/repositories/building_repository_impl.rs
impl BuildingRepository for PostgresBuildingRepository {
    async fn create(&self, building: &Building) -> Result<Building, String> {
        // PostgreSQL implementation
    }
}
```

When adding new features:
- Start with Domain entity/service
- Define Application port (trait)
- Create Use Case
- Implement Infrastructure adapter
- Add Web handler

## Commands

### Development Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL only
make docker-up

# Copy environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Start backend (localhost:8080)
cd backend && cargo run

# Start frontend (localhost:3000)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

**Important**: Use `make dev` for backend with auto-reload (requires `cargo-watch`), or `make dev-all` to start all services via Docker Compose.

### Testing (Pyramid Strategy)

```bash
# Unit tests (domain logic, 100% coverage target)
cargo test --lib

# Single test
cargo test --lib test_create_building_success

# Integration tests (with testcontainers)
cargo test --test integration
# OR: make test-integration

# BDD tests (Cucumber/Gherkin)
cargo test --test bdd
# Features in: backend/tests/features/*.feature

# E2E tests (full API)
cargo test --test e2e

# Benchmarks (Criterion)
cargo bench

# All tests
make test

# Coverage report (uses tarpaulin)
make coverage
# Output: coverage/index.html
```

**Test Structure**:
- Unit tests: In-module `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- Integration: `backend/tests/integration/`
- BDD: `backend/tests/bdd.rs` + `backend/tests/features/`
- E2E: `backend/tests/e2e/`
- Benchmarks: `backend/benches/`

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format
cargo fmt                    # Backend
npm run format              # Frontend (in frontend/)
make format                 # Both

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Backend
make lint                    # Backend + frontend build check

# Security audit
make audit
```

### Database

```bash
# Run migrations
cd backend && sqlx migrate run
# OR: make migrate

# Create new migration
cd backend && sqlx migrate add <name>

# Seed test data (if bin exists)
cargo run --bin seed
```

### GitHub Project Management Export

```bash
# Export GitHub data (issues, milestones, projects) to RST
make docs-export-github
# Output: docs/github-export/

# Exported data includes:
# - All issues (organized by phase, priority, label)
# - All milestones with their issues
# - GitHub Projects overview
# - Labels catalog
```

**Usage for Claude Code Web**:
Claude Code Web doesn't have direct access to GitHub API. The RST export allows it to access all project management data by simply cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gilmry/koprogo.git
# Browse docs/github-export/ for complete project info
```

The export is integrated into Sphinx documentation under "GitHub Project Management" section.

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Release build (with LTO optimization)
cargo build --release

# Docker
docker-compose up           # All services
docker-compose up postgres  # PostgreSQL only
docker-compose logs -f      # Follow logs

# Build images
make docker-build
```

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
- **Secret Achievement Visibility**: SQL LEFT JOIN to show non-secret achievements OR secret achievements the user has earned
- **Auto-Completion Logic**: When incrementing challenge progress, automatically mark as completed if current_value >= target_value
- **Multi-Source Leaderboard**: Aggregate points from both achievements (points_value × times_earned) and challenges (reward_points)
- **State Machine Validation**: Challenge state transitions enforced in domain layer (Draft → Active → Completed/Cancelled)
- **Repeatable Achievements**: times_earned counter with validation (must be >= 1)
- **Partial Index Optimization**: idx_challenges_active for common query (active challenges WHERE start_date <= NOW AND end_date > NOW)

  * Codes HTTP: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error
  * Documentation inline avec exemple de réponse JSON
- **Routes** (routes.rs):
  * Endpoint public ajouté en tête de scope (avant middleware auth)
  * Position stratégique pour éviter interception par middleware
- **Conformité**: Loi belge sur transparence des syndics de copropriété
- **Total**: 1 migration, 7 DB fields, 3 Building methods, 1 DTO, 1 Use Case method, 1 REST handler, 1 public endpoint

### ✅ NOUVEAU: Board Decision Poll System - Issue #51 (Phase 2)

- Système de sondages pour consultations rapides entre assemblées générales (conforme à la loi belge)
- **Belgian Legal Context**: Article 577-8/4 §4 Code Civil Belge allows syndic consultations between general assemblies
- **4 Poll Types**:
  * **YesNo**: Simple yes/no decisions (e.g., "Should we repaint the lobby in blue?")
  * **MultipleChoice**: Choice between options (e.g., contractor selection) with single or multiple selection support
  * **Rating**: 1-5 star satisfaction surveys (configurable min/max rating)
  * **OpenEnded**: Free-text feedback collection (e.g., improvement suggestions)
- **Poll Lifecycle**: Draft → Active → Closed/Cancelled
  * **Draft**: Initial state, editable, not visible to owners
  * **Active**: Published poll, owners can vote, time-bound (starts_at to ends_at)
  * **Closed**: Voting ended, results calculated (winner, participation rate, vote breakdown)
  * **Cancelled**: Poll cancelled before completion
- **Anonymous Voting Support**:
  * `is_anonymous = true`: owner_id NULL in poll_votes, only ip_address stored for audit
  * `is_anonymous = false`: Full vote attribution with owner_id
  * Belgian privacy compliance (GDPR Article 6 consent-based processing)
- **Duplicate Vote Prevention**:
  * Database UNIQUE constraint on (poll_id, owner_id) for non-anonymous votes
  * Business logic validation for anonymous votes (IP-based rate limiting recommended)
  * Error response: "You have already voted on this poll"
- **Participation Tracking**:
  * `total_eligible_voters`: Count of active unit owners in building (TODO: replace hardcoded value)
  * `total_votes_cast`: Real-time vote count
  * `participation_rate`: (total_votes_cast / total_eligible_voters) * 100
- **Results Calculation**:
  * **YesNo**: Winner = option with most votes, percentage = (votes / total_votes_cast) * 100
  * **MultipleChoice**: Ranked options by vote_count DESC
  * **Rating**: Average rating + distribution histogram
  * **OpenEnded**: Text aggregation + export functionality
- **Multi-Select Support**: `allow_multiple_votes = true` for MultipleChoice polls (e.g., "Select up to 3 amenities")
- **Automatic Expiration**: Background job checks `ends_at <= NOW()` and auto-closes active polls
- **Domain Entities**:
  * `Poll` (572 lines): Core poll aggregate with validation (starts_at < ends_at, rating range 1-5, question non-empty)
  * `PollOption` (188 lines): Poll answer options with vote_count tracking
  * `PollVote` (214 lines): Individual votes with anonymization support
- **Repository Pattern**:
  * `PollRepository` trait (16 methods) - PostgresPollRepository
  * `PollOptionRepository` trait (12 methods) - PostgresPollOptionRepository
  * `PollVoteRepository` trait (10 methods) - PostgresPollVoteRepository
  * Complex queries: active polls, vote aggregation, duplicate detection, result calculation
- **Use Cases** (687 lines):
  * `PollUseCases` - 18 methods (CRUD, lifecycle transitions, voting, results)
  * Requires 3 repositories: Poll, PollOption, PollVote
  * Multi-repository orchestration for voting (check duplicate, increment vote_count, create vote record)
- **REST API** (12 endpoints, ~500 lines):
  * Poll Management: create, get, list (all/active/by-status), delete
  * Lifecycle: publish (Draft → Active), close (Active → Closed), cancel (→ Cancelled)
  * Voting: cast vote (with duplicate prevention), list votes (admin only)
  * Analytics: get results (vote counts, percentages, winner, participation rate)
- **Migration** (20251203120000_create_polls.sql, 156 lines):
  * Table: `polls` (16 columns, 7 indexes, 5 constraints)
  * Table: `poll_options` (7 columns, 3 indexes, 2 constraints)
  * Table: `poll_votes` (9 columns, 4 indexes, 3 constraints including UNIQUE(poll_id, owner_id) for duplicate prevention)
  * Custom ENUMs: `poll_type` (YesNo, MultipleChoice, Rating, OpenEnded), `poll_status` (Draft, Active, Closed, Cancelled)
  * Partial indexes: idx_polls_active (WHERE status = 'Active'), idx_polls_building_active (building_id, status WHERE status = 'Active')
  * Constraints: starts_at < ends_at, total_votes_cast >= 0, rating range validation
- **DTOs** (6 DTOs, ~180 lines):
  * `CreatePollDto`, `PublishPollDto`, `CastVoteDto`
  * `PollResponseDto`, `PollOptionResponseDto`, `PollVoteResponseDto`
  * `PollResultsDto` (winner, vote breakdown, participation rate)
- **Audit Events** (8 types, GDPR Article 30 compliance):
  * `PollCreated`, `PollPublished`, `PollClosed`, `PollCancelled`, `PollDeleted`
  * `PollVoteCast`, `PollResultsCalculated`, `PollExpired` (auto-close job)
- **Total Scope**:
  * ~2,500 lines of code across 4 layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Migration)
  * 3 domain entities (24 unit tests)
  * 6 DTOs
  * 3 repository traits + 3 PostgreSQL implementations (38 methods total)
  * 1 use case class (18 methods)
  * 12 REST endpoints
  * 1 migration (3 tables, 2 ENUMs, 14 indexes, 10 constraints)
  * 8 audit event types
  * 1 BDD feature file (20 Gherkin scenarios covering all workflows)
- **Files Created**:
  * Domain: `poll.rs` (572 lines), `poll_option.rs` (188 lines), `poll_vote.rs` (214 lines)
  * DTOs: `poll_dto.rs` (~180 lines)
  * Ports: `poll_repository.rs`, `poll_option_repository.rs`, `poll_vote_repository.rs`
  * Implementations: `poll_repository_impl.rs` (511 lines), `poll_option_repository_impl.rs` (312 lines), `poll_vote_repository_impl.rs` (248 lines)
  * Use Cases: `poll_use_cases.rs` (687 lines)
  * Handlers: `poll_handlers.rs` (~500 lines)
  * Migration: `20251203120000_create_polls.sql` (156 lines)
  * BDD Tests: `backend/tests/features/polls.feature` (261 lines, 20 scenarios)
- **Commits** (4 commits):
  * 728548f: feat: Poll System - Domain, DTOs, Repositories (Issue #51 Part 1)
  * 48f18f4: feat: Poll System - Use Cases + REST Handlers (Issue #51 Part 2)
  * 23d75df: feat: Poll System - PostgreSQL Repository Implementations (Issue #51 Part 3)
  * d7c3e32: feat: Wire Poll System to AppState (Issue #51 Part 4)
- **TODO**:
  * Replace hardcoded `total_eligible_voters = 10` in poll_use_cases.rs:145 with proper unit_owners count query
  * Implement background job for auto-close expired polls (cron job checking ends_at <= NOW())
  * E2E tests deferred until repository pattern migration complete

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
- **State Machine Validation**: Poll status transitions enforced in domain layer (only Draft → Active, Active → Closed/Cancelled)
- **Duplicate Vote Prevention**: Database-level UNIQUE constraint + business logic validation
- **Anonymous Voting Privacy**: Conditional owner_id NULL with ip_address audit trail
- **Atomic Vote Casting**: Multi-repository transaction (create vote + increment option vote_count + increment poll total_votes_cast)
- **Belgian Legal Advisory**: Poll results documented in next general assembly minutes per Code Civil Article 577-8/4 §4

### Multi-owner support

- Junction table `unit_owners` (see `backend/migrations/20250127000000_refactor_owners_multitenancy.sql`) enables many-to-many between units and owners.
- Domain entity: `backend/src/domain/entities/unit_owner.rs` (pourcentage `0.0 < p ≤ 1.0`, timestamps, primary contact).
- Use cases: `backend/src/application/use_cases/unit_owner_use_cases.rs` (somme des quotes-parts ≤ 100 %, transfert, historique, contact principal unique).
- **✅ NOUVEAU: Validation stricte des quotes-parts** (Issue #29 - migration `20251120230000_add_unit_ownership_validation.sql`):
  * Règle métier belge: Total des quotes-parts actives = 100% (Article 577-2 §4 Code Civil)
  * Trigger PostgreSQL `validate_unit_ownership_total()` avec tolérance ±0.01% pour arrondis
  * BLOQUE les dépassements > 100% (erreur 23514: check_violation)
  * AVERTIT si < 100% (permet états transitoires lors d'ajouts séquentiels)
  * Validation uniquement sur propriétaires actifs (`end_date IS NULL`)
- Web handlers: `backend/src/infrastructure/web/handlers/unit_owner_handlers.rs` exposent les routes `/api/v1/units/{id}/owners`, `/unit-owners/{id}`, `/units/{id}/owners/transfer`, etc.
- Tests : `backend/tests/integration_unit_owner.rs` (PostgreSQL) + BDD multi-tenant.
- Frontend Svelte : `frontend/src/components/UnitOwners.svelte`, `OwnerList.svelte`, `OwnerCreateModal.svelte`, `OwnerEditModal.svelte`.
- Documentation produit : `docs/MULTI_OWNER_SUPPORT.md`.

### Multi-role support

- Table `user_roles` (migration `20250130000000_add_user_roles.sql`).
- Domain entity: `backend/src/domain/entities/user_role_assignment.rs`.
- Repository: `PostgresUserRoleRepository` (création, switch primary, liste).
- Use cases: `AuthUseCases::login`, `AuthUseCases::switch_active_role`, `AuthUseCases::refresh_token`.
- Middleware `AuthenticatedUser` expose `role_id`.
- Endpoints `/auth/login`, `/auth/switch-role`, `/auth/me` (JWT avec rôle actif).
- Frontend: `authStore.switchRole`, `Navigation.svelte` (sélecteur multi-rôle).
- Tests:
  - E2E: `tests/e2e_auth.rs` (scénario multi-rôles).
  - BDD: `features/auth.feature` (issue #28).
  - Docs: `docs/MULTI_ROLE_SUPPORT.md`.

## Performance Targets

- **Latency P99**: < 5ms
- **Throughput**: > 100k req/s
- **Memory**: < 128MB per instance
- **Connection Pool**: Max 10 PostgreSQL connections
- **Compilation**: Release mode with `opt-level = 3`, `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`

## Database Configuration

PostgreSQL 15 via Docker:
- Database: `koprogo_db`
- User: `koprogo` / Password: `koprogo123` (dev only)
- Port: `5432`
- Connection string: `postgresql://koprogo:koprogo123@localhost:5432/koprogo_db`

Migrations managed via `sqlx migrate` in `backend/migrations/`.

## Testing Philosophy

Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development):
1. Write tests first (especially for domain logic)
2. Implement to pass tests
3. Refactor with test safety net

**BDD Features**: Write Gherkin scenarios in `backend/tests/features/` for user-facing behaviors.

**Integration Tests**: Use testcontainers for real PostgreSQL instances, ensuring tests are isolated.

### Test-Driven Emergence: BDD ↔ E2E ↔ Vidéo

L'application émerge des tests, pas l'inverse. Le même scénario métier est la **source de vérité unique** exprimée à 3 niveaux :

```
Scénario métier (narratif multi-rôles avec sémantique copropriété belge)
  ↓ Gherkin
BDD intégration (backend/tests/features/) — valide le contrat comportemental
  ↓ même narratif
E2E Documentation Vivante (frontend/tests/e2e/scenarios/) — prouve le parcours UI
  ↓ vidéo générée
Preuve visuelle (YouTube/stakeholders) — couronne la spec
```

**Alignement BDD ↔ E2E** : Pour chaque workflow, le BDD et le E2E partagent les mêmes acteurs, données et étapes :
```
BDD:  Given the syndic has created resolution "Travaux" / When "Alice" votes "Pour" / Then adopted
E2E:  humanLogin(syndic) → create resolution → humanLogin(alice) → vote Pour → close → finalPause
```

Si le BDD passe mais le E2E échoue → bug frontend. Si les deux échouent → problème de spec/backend.

**RACE matrix** : La plastique UI (thèmes, layouts, styling) est découplée de la fonctionnalité. Une matrice RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) mappe les segments utilisateurs aux préférences visuelles, appliquée comme couche CSS/thème au-dessus de la fonctionnalité testée.

### E2E Scenarios: Sémantique Métier & Narratif Multi-Rôles

Les scénarios Playwright "Documentation Vivante" (`frontend/tests/e2e/scenarios/`) servent de documentation vidéo (YouTube). Ils DOIVENT refléter la réalité métier d'une copropriété belge, pas juste exercer l'UI.

**Règle fondamentale**: Toujours se demander "qui fait cette action dans une vraie copropriété ?"

**Rôles et responsabilités métier**:
- **Syndic**: Gère l'immeuble, crée les AG/résolutions, envoie les convocations, gère les devis/budgets, approuve les factures, assigne les tickets
- **Copropriétaire (Owner)**: Signale les tickets, vote aux AG, ajoute ses moyens de paiement, participe aux échanges SEL, répond aux sondages, lit les annonces
- **SuperAdmin**: Configuration plateforme, gestion orgs/users
- **Comptable**: Rapports financiers, écritures comptables

**Scénarios multi-rôles**: Quand un workflow implique plusieurs acteurs, le scénario doit faire `humanLogin` successivement dans le MÊME test :
```typescript
// Étape 1: Le syndic crée la résolution
await humanLogin(page, syndicEmail, syndicPassword);
// ... actions syndic ...
await stepPause(page);

// Étape 2: Le copropriétaire vote
await page.goto("/login");
await humanLogin(page, ownerEmail, ownerPassword);
// ... actions copropriétaire ...
await stepPause(page);

// Étape 3: Le syndic clôture le scrutin
await page.goto("/login");
await humanLogin(page, syndicEmail, syndicPassword);
// ... actions syndic ...
await finalPause(page);
```

**Mapping fonctionnalité → rôle(s)**:
| Feature | Qui agit |
|---------|----------|
| Ticket | Owner crée → Syndic assigne/gère |
| Vote AG | Syndic crée résolution → Owner vote → Syndic clôture |
| SEL (échanges) | Owner A offre ↔ Owner B demande (jamais le syndic) |
| Sondages | Syndic publie → Owner répond |
| Annonces | Syndic crée → Owner lit |
| Convocations | Syndic envoie → Owner confirme présence |
| Moyens paiement | Owner configure (son propre paiement) |
| Devis/Budgets/Factures | Syndic gère (single role OK) |
